What's in the Drink? Challenge
==============================================================

'What's in the Drink' is a game developed to test a user's knowledge about some of the world's most popular cocktails. There are 8 cocktails currently available. User has to select the correct ingrediants and submit the response. There is also a Tutorial section prepared that helps the user to know the key ingrediants that go in these cocktails. 


How to Play?
-------------------------
On the Home page, user has to select a cocktail. Once the user is on the Cocktail specific page, he/she is expected to select the main ingrediants that go in the cocktail and submit the response. There is a judge who provides clues in case of incorrect responses like missed basic ingrediants, additional ones present, key ingredients missing. 

During every challenge, there is a Tutorial link shown on the page. On clicking, the user can go to the ingredients of the specific cocktail to brush up the bartending skills and come back to take the challenge. 



Technologies Used: 
-------------------------

The game has been built using Javascript, HTML, CSS, DOM.  


Design:
-------------------------

As the game needed volume, the functions are very reusable. There is no Cocktail specific function that has been written. Most of the HTML is rendered dynamically. The logic for different responses (GIFs and response message) is reusable as well. There is an array of objects for the Master List of Ingredients. Additionally, primary and secondary ingredients are defined in the Javascript for every cocktail. These values are then passed to the reusable functions.
